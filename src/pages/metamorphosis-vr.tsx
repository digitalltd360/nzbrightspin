              the Catness Games team thoroughly examined the existing game
              system, focusing on the key elements that could benefit from a
              first-person perspective via a VR headset. Our goal was to adapt
              and design the behavior of both existing and new mechanics that
              would make a correct and intuitive use of the Quest motion
              controllers.

              Once these core gameplay foundations were established, the team
              faced the challenging task of bringing the large and detailed
              world from the PC version to a significantly less powerful system,
              one that also needed to render the game on two 1832Ã—1920 displays
              at a stable 90 frames per second, crucial for preventing motion
              sickness and preserving player immersion.

              To accomplish this, the developers focused on optimizing polygon
              counts and texture sizes while preserving as much visual fidelity
              as possible. They also revised the lighting and shader systems to
              ensure they performed smoothly at a consistently high frame rate.
              In parallel, the team also fine-tuned collision boxes,
              environmental scales, and hand-controller interactions to
              guarantee a natural and intuitive gameplay experience.
